====================

A meteor.js-based web dashboard of some metrics collected from different APIs
Currently it collects metrics from

* Tumblr
* Twitter
* Github
* LastFM
* Foursquare
* Coderwall

and displays them relatively boring as numbers.
Data is collected to allow historical overviews and trend analysis as well as plotting them to neat diagrams.
Some of the Foursquare data can already be plotted, using Flot.
